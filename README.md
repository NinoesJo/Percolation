# Percolation
Simulate the percolation threshold on an NxN grid using Monte Carlo methods. Implement PercolationDFS, PercolationBFS, and PercolationUF classes for depth-first, breadth-first, and union-find approaches. Test using JUnit and interactive visualizer, then analyze performance and compare trade-offs in each approach.
